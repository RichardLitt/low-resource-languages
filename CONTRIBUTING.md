# Contributing

Welcome to the low-resource-languages list.

Please feel free to contribute in any way you can: by submitting links, by engaging in discussions on the issues, and so on. All are welcome. This is a very open project.

## Guidelines for submitting resources

- Link directly to the resource or to the page describing the resource.
- The blurb after the link should be something short - the GitHub description generally works well, although the blurb may have to be written manually for non-GitHub links or for GitHub links which lack descriptions.
- Make sure each link is on one line, to help with automatic alphabetization.
- Alphabetize your entry.
- If a language entry for your specific tool does not exist, please create one.
- Update the Table of Contents if you can. This can be done automatically with [`doctoc`](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc).
- Check that your links work. We will automatically catch any broken links using TravisCI.

If any of this is arduous, please open a PR with what you have and we can work together to make it fit.

## Offline requests

If you're interested in discussing the list in some offline capacity, get in touch with @RichardLitt. I'd be more than happy to have a phone call or email exchange.
