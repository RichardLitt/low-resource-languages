Endangered Languages
====================

**A list of resources for conservation, preservation, development, and documentation of endangered, minority, and low or under resourced human languages.**

It has struck me that there is no centralised list of open-source code that would be useful for documenting, conserving, developing, preserving, or in any way working with endangered languages. According to some estimates, half of the 7,000~ currently spoken languages are expected to become extinct this century [1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_preservation). However, there is a plethora of work by academics, independant scholars, organizations, communities, and individuals that may be of use in helping to slowing this process. This list is intended to provide a central location to document those efforts. Please submit pull requests if you know of any resource available that is not on this list, either on Github or not, either code or otherwise.

Endangered languages is here meant to mean human languages that are in danger of extinction (for example, Yurok); this list also encompasses minority languages - languages which are spoken by a stable, but small, population (for example, Maltese or Hawai'ian); and low or under resourced languages, which are spoken by a significant population by under-represented on the web (for instance, Quechua). These languages share certain characteristics in common; the most pertinent is sparse data and a lack of resources, ranging from spell-checkers to grammars to machine translation corpora. Other under resourced languages that do not fall under this list include constructed languages (for instance, Klingon or Na'vi), computer languages (for instance, Go or Lua), and extinct languages that are so sparse as to be rendered computationally irrelevant for most purposes (for instance, Tocharian or Pictish).   

Looking for code languages? Take a look at [the awesome collection of other awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

_Currently, this is mainly a list of Github repositories. Any and all other submissions welcome._
